CBMod v1.2 Update Notes:


New Legendary Zombies added:

New Wandering Hordes Added and Wandering Hordes re-balanced
-Wandering Hordes are still pretty..."girthy"...but new groups have been added that appear as Wandering Hordes.  
-Boar, Bear and Wolf hordes are all now in the rotation (only wolf hordes were previously).  These will give players an early chance
at a TON of meat, leather and animal fat....but will require a fight to do so. Albeit, a much more manageable fight than normal hordes.

New Quest Lines added: Ankle Breaker (2 parts) and Moose Steaks.
-Multi-part Quests are no longer 2 separate quests, and are now chained to trigger Part 2 after completing Part 1. (Twitch Buffet, Upgrade Complete and Ankle Breaker)



Recipes added to use Bones to replace wood in Arrow variations.  Because you tend to collect a ton of bones.
Recipes added for Nailgun components to be able to individually craft nailguns instead of just assembling the scavenged components. Unlocked by the Nailgun schematic.
Recipes added for Bandit Armor. Recipe locked behind Do It Yourself levels 4 and 5.
Recipe added to craft Vitamins. Locked behind SCIENCE BITCHES!! perk.
Recipe for lead fishingWeight added to be able to create fishingWeights in the Workbench. Locked behind Do It Yourself level 1.
Recipe for BFG Ammo now requires fishingWeights to craft.

Molotov Cocktails now upgradeable to make Napalm Cocktails. More intense fire damage, wider radius for fire and mini-explosion.
--Recipe requires Molotov Cocktails, Plastic and Fishing Weights. 

Added Poured Concrete and Reinforced Concrete stages of Log Spikes (between Scrap Iron and Steel).  
-Also added recipe for Poured Concrete Log Spikes to be able to skip ahead to this stage while crafting.
-Log Spikes now follow the same building structure as regular blocks do (Wood-->Scrap Iron-->Concrete-->Steel-->Polished Steel). Also break down the same way regular blocks do now as well.

Added Grassless versions of Grassy, Plains, Forest and Burnt Ground blocks. Purely a "quality of life" addition but these blocks won't grow grass on top.

2 new Variations of Dart Traps added: Fire and Electric.
-Each Dart needed its own variation of the Dart Trap to fire that specific ammo. So Fire Dart Traps fire Fire Darts, etc.


XP Required to level up Archery and Barter skills lowered. 
-Barter is still higher than in vanilla so harder to level up, but it was too difficult to reach Secret Stash previously in CBMod.

Arrows of all types now stack to 250 again.


Increased Wellness Gain from eating food recipes custom to CBMod. Since you die a lot, you probably need to re-gain wellness...

Wellness now capped at 300

Bad Mechanic 10 now locked behind Player Level 150 instead of Player Level 120. The level cap is 300, so halfway.....
Better Lead Than Dead now goes up to Level 10 instead of 5. Should've been already. My bad guys.
Added Run TS Forrest Run - a callback to the Run Forest Run perk that also makes a reference of TSForrest from the Twitch 7D2D community.

COMPLETELY REVAMPED Legendary Loot Table:
--Each Legendary Zombie now has its OWN loot table, which includes the only chance at a Legendary Zombie and Legendary Quest note tied to that OTHER zombie.

--ex. BirdLaw loot has a chance of carrying Our Lord and Savior and the "May The Odds" quest, which involves killing SecondClassElitist with the OLAS. 
SCE has a chance of carrying the Golden Gun, GG Ammo and the GG Quest, which is used to kill MidnightDesigner in his quest. etc.

--Legendary Weapon Quests are now only found on Legendary zombies.
--Pseudo-Legendary Weapons are no longer found in Gun Safes or Munition Boxes. 
--Whiz Wit parts are now found in Gun Safes and Munitions Boxes though.

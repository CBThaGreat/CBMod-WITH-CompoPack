CBMod v1.2 Legendary Zombie Guide:

ALL of the named Legendary Zombies are named after streamers on Twitch that are not only popular in the 7 Days to Die community, but also have ties to me personally.
I ask if you have enjoyed kicking the shit out of any/all of them and are reading this, you take the time to check out their Twitch Links listed at the end of their descriptions.
They're all enjoyable content creators and deserve all the support in the world. Plus....it's free to follow on Twitch...so yeah do it.
